# Welcome to the Windows Sandbox repo!

Windows Sandbox allows users to run a lightweight desktop environment in a secure Hyper-V isolated container. It creates a disposable instance of Windows that enables the ability to run any win32 application you wish with a pristine configuration every time you start it. It allows you to do virtually whatever you want within an isolated desktop environment without requiring any cleanup after the fact. Whether it be testing an unknown application or performing large computational tasks with many temporary files, Windows Sandbox makes it easy to employ a dedicated environment for whatever task is at hand.

This repository is a dedicated space for useful developments surrounding Windows Sandbox. It is a mixture of utilities generated by both the Microsoft kernel team and the community of Windows Sandbox users. If you want to learn more about how Windows Sandbox works please go take a look at the [MSDN documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview).

## Prerequisites

A host computer running Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise Insider build 18362 or newer is currently needed to run Windows Sandbox. In addition to this you must ensure that virtualization is enabled on your machine:
- If you are using a physical machine, ensure virtualization capabilities are enabled in the BIOS.
- If you are using a virtual machine, enable nested virtualization with this PowerShell cmdlet:
    
    ```Set-VMProcessor -VMName <VMName> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true```
