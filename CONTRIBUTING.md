# Windows Sandbox Contributor's Guide
Below is our guidance for how to report issues, propose new features, and submit community repositories built on top of Windows Sandbox.

## Reporting security issues
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). See https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/blob/main/SECURITY.md for more information.

## Filing issues

### Search existing issues 
Before filing a new issue, search our MSDN documentation, existing open and closed issues first. It is likely someone else has found the problem you're seeing. If you see an issue that you are 
facing too but don't have additional context/info to add but like to indicate that you are affected by the issue, upvote the original issue by clicking its [+üòä] button and hitting üëç (+1) icon. 
This way we can measure how impactful an issue is.

If no existing item describes your issue/feature, great - please file a new issue:

### What type of issue do I file?
- Don't know whether you're reporting an issue or requesting a feature? File an issue
- Want to know if we're planning on building a particular feature? File a feature request
- Got a great idea for a new feature? File a feature request
- Found issues in our repository? File an issue
- Found issues in our documentation? File a documentation issue
- Have a question that you don't see answered in docs, blogs, etc.? File a documentation issue
- Don't understand how to do something? File a 'help-wanted' issue
- Found an existing issue that describes yours? Great - upvote and add additional commentary / info / repro-steps / etc.

In general, when you hit "New Issue", select the type of issue closest to what you want to report/ask/request.

### Complete the issue template
Complete the information requested in the issue template, providing as much information as possible. The more information you provide, the more likely your issue/ask will be understood and implemented. 

A well written issue includes the following:
- Issue title is descriptive and short
- Windows version and build number. This can be gathered from the CMD prompt using the `cmd.exe --version` command.
- Device information (including CPU type, memory, disk etc.)
- Detailed repro steps. We LOVE detailed repro steps! What steps do we need to take to reproduce the issue? Assume we love to read repro steps. As much detail as you can stand is probably barely enough detail for us! We prefer error message text where possible or screenshots of errors if text cannot be captured.
- Behavior you were expecting

### Closing issues 
Issues and discussions may be closed by the original poster at any time. We will close issues if:
- The issue has been addressed
- The issue is a duplicate of another issue
- Discussions or questions that have ran their course
